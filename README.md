# PySpiceVisualizer

## Commnet
Due to a confidentiality agreement for the joint research, I created a different code and circuit from the one used in the research. This is a program I created to use for job hunting.

## Only Windows Platforms
This is a program that will only work correctly on **Windows platforms**.

This asc file is included by default.

## What can we do?
1. Using PyLTSpice, it is possible to create and execute a netlist with different conditions from a single asc file.
2. you can see the frequency characteristics using numpy.

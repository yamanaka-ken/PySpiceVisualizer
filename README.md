## Commnet
Due to a confidentiality agreement for the joint research, I created a different code and circuit from the one used in the research. This is a program I created to use for job hunting.

## Only Windows Platforms
This is a program that will only work correctly on **Windows platforms**.

This asc file is included by default.
